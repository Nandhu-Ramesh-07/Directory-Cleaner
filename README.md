# Directory Cleaner

A simple Python script to clean directories by removing files based on file type or removing entire folders. This tool is useful for managing your file system by automating cleanup tasks.

## Features
- **Delete files by extension**: Specify the file extension (e.g., `pdf`, `txt`) and remove all files of that type.
- **Delete entire directory contents**: Use the `entire` option to delete all files and folders within the specified directory.
- **Logging**: All actions are logged in `deletion_log.txt`.
- **Confirmation**: A prompt appears before any deletion to ensure that the user intends to delete the files.
